<em>Juan Jos√© Garcia, Smiti Kaul, Saumya Ray, Sandeep Kumar</em>

Countries prioritize national expenditure in various sectors of citizen issues based upon evaluations that judge the impact and value of such public funding. This work aims to be such evaluation of the education sector by determining the correlation between citizens' self-development and societal contribution. We hypothesize, public spending  on education (\% of GDP spent on education) determines educational access (percentage of population enrolled in education) and resources for a government's constituents (GDP per capita). Along these lines, this work computes a correlation between public expenditure on education and educational enrollment levels across low, middle, and high income countries. Correlation is computed with a p-value between education enrollment, GDP per capita, and public expenditure. Clustering is done through a latent variable model upon United Nation's data. Our results match up greater GDP per capita with higher percentage of population enrolled and (approximately) higher percentage of GDP invested in education.
